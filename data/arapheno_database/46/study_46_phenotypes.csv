Arabidopsis thaliana (NCBI: 3702),768,Gravitropic setpoint angle (GSA),10.21958/phenotype:768,Gravitropic setpoint angle (GSA),"Plates with 14-day-old seedlings were scanned and the initial gravitropic set-point angle (iGSA) of individual LRs was measured with reference to the gravity vector7 using Image J software. All available LR from each seedling were measured. Individual GSA values were then sorted into eight categories: 0–30°, 31–50°, 51–70°, 71–90°, 91–110°, 111–180°.",,0,"Seeds were surfaced sterilized and stratified at 4°C for 2 days in the dark. Seedligns were grown vertically on half Murashige and Skoog medium for 14 days.
