Arabidopsis thaliana (NCBI: 3702),294,GR21,10.21958/phenotype:294,Kerdaffrec et al. 2016,"Seeds from three biological replicates per line were pooled together to compensate for growth chamber heterogeneity. About 100 seeds per genotype were spread on wet filter paper in Petri dishes subsequently placed in moisture chambers (following protocol of Alonso-Blanco et al., 2003) that were located in a culture room set at 25°C with a long-day light regime (16 hr light, 8 hr dark). Germination rate (GR21) was determined after 7 days of incubation by scoring radicle emergence.",,,"Three biological replicates of each Swedish line were grown under long-day conditions (16 hr light, 8 hr dark) for 8 weeks at 4°C to ensure proper vernalization. Temperature was then raised to 21°C (day) and 16°C (night) until seed harvest. Watering was individually monitored and stopped when about half of the siliques of a given plant had ripened. Seeds were harvested 10 days later. After-ripening was performed in the dark at 16°C with 30% relative humidity for 21 days.",2017-09-19T09:33:44.659000Z,0,TO:0000253,seed dormancy,,,PTO,Plant Trait Ontology,https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PTO,EO:0007269,growth chamber study,"""The treatment involving study type in which plants were grown in growth chambers.""
