Plants were grown under controlled long-day conditions (16 hr light; 23 oC/8 hr darkness; 18 oC; relative air humidity 60 %). Three seedlings per genotype were planted into individual pots at the first true leaf stage. Three approximately fingernail-sized mature; non-senescent rosette leaves per plant were collected at the age of 5 weeks (at which point plants of some but not all of the genotypes were beginning to bolt).,2023-05-17T13:48:29.003826Z,0,TO:0000911,trichome morphology trait,"""A plant structure morphology trait (TO:0000839) which is a quality of a trichome (PO:0000282).""
