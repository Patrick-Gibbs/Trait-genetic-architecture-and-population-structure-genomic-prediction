Arabidopsis thaliana (NCBI: 3702),1910,Raffinose 32C,10.21958/phenotype:1910,Raffinose (22°C and 32°C),Soluble carbohydrates were detected using a Waters Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Waters Micromass Quattro Premier triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Raffonose concentration was measured as nmol/g FW.,,0,"eeds were sown on agar plates with ½-strength Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium (Duchefa Biochemie B.V., Haarlem, Netherlands), pH 5.7, containing 3% (w/v) sucrose and 1.2% (w/v) phyto agar (Duchefa Biochemie B.V.), and stratified for 7 days at 4 °C in the dark. After stratification plates were transferred to a growth chamber with 9 h/15 h (day/night) photoperiod set to 22 °C and 100-120 µmol m-2 s-1 (white fluorescent light) in a randomised manner and regularly shifted within the growth chamber to avoid any positional effects on seedling establishment and growth. On day 15, seedlings were transferred to a pre-heated growth chamber at 32 °C at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 2, i.e., two hours after onset of the light period. Control seedlings remained in the 22 °C growth chamber. After four hours seedlings were harvested, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until extraction.",2023-06-22T08:22:14.355610Z,0,TO:0000291,carbohydrate content,"""A metabolite content trait (TO:0000281) which is the amount of carbohydrate (CHEBI:16646) in a plant structure (PO:0009011).""
